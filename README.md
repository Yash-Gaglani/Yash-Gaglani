# Hi there, I'm Yash Gaglani üëã

## üöÄ About Me

With over 2 years of experience in software development, I specialize in building innovative solutions using Java, Spring Framework, and RESTful APIs. My work spans across multiple domains, including healthcare, where I've successfully developed and delivered a full-fledged Hospital Management Information System (HMIS). I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and driving business success through efficient software solutions.

## üíª Skills

- **Languages:** Java
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Cloud
- **API Development:** RESTful APIs, Microservices
- **Platforms & Tools:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Postman
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

### [Healink](https://www.healink.ing)
*Developed at Magneton Technologies*

- **Role:** Lead Developer
- **Description:** A comprehensive HMIS solution with features like appointment booking, digital prescriptions, role-based access control, video conferencing, and integration with SNOMED and FHIR for standardized medical record sharing.
- **Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, AWS

### Motifizer: A Gene Expression Regulation Predictor
*Developed as an academic project*

- **Role:** Lead Developer
- **Description:** A novel pipeline to predict gene regulatory patterns, optimizing pre-existing processes for researchers.
- **Tech Stack:** Docker, Python

### [RSA Encryption Framework](https://github.com/Yash-Gaglani/RSA-Encryption-Framework)
*Designed for secure communication*

- **Role:** Developer
- **Description:** This project provides an API for RSA encryption and decryption, enabling users to securely encrypt data using RSA keys. It includes endpoints for retrieving public certificates, encrypting plaintext, and decrypting encrypted messages.
- **Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, RSA encryption
- **Key Features:**
  - Public certificate retrieval
  - Encryption and decryption support using RSA keys
  - Configurable through `application.properties` for key management

### [Firebase Kafka Consumer](https://github.com/Yash-Gaglani/Firebase-Kafka-Consumer)
*Kafka-based notification system*

- **Role:** Lead Developer
- **Description:** A microservice designed to handle Firebase notifications by consuming messages from Apache Kafka. It processes these messages and sends push notifications to devices via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). This offloads notification processing from the main application, improving performance.
- **Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, Firebase
- **Key Features:**
  - Kafka consumer for real-time notification processing
  - Integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging
  - Configurable topics and consumer group settings via `application.properties`

## üìö Education

**Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology**  
*Maharashtra Institute of Technology, Pune*  
*2016 - 2020*  
CGPA: 8.7/10

## üìñ Currently Learning

I'm expanding my expertise into cutting-edge technologies like **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to build intelligent systems that combine the power of language models with external knowledge retrieval. RAG enhances the ability to provide more relevant and contextual answers by incorporating retrieved data into the generation process.

- **Focus Areas:** 
  - Integrating RAG with existing applications.
  - Building superior conversational systems and applications.
  - Exploring LangChain for advanced AI solutions.

## üèÜ Achievements

- **Winners, Impetus and Concepts (InC):** Best Project at a national-level technical event organized by PICT, Pune.
- **Finalists, HACKSAGON 2020:** Runner-up in a prestigious project showcase competition hosted by ABV-IIITM IEEE Student Branch.
- **Finalists, Ingenious 2020:** Distinguished participant at Ingenious 2020 organized by I¬≤IT ACM.
